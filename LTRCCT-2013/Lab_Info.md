## Before starting the labs

1. Please confirm that you can login to WxCC Admin portal and Agent desktop by using the links above.

2. You have to use the admin account (with Administrator privileges) for the access to the Control Hub and Administration portal. 

3. Agent desktop login should use a user with  premium agent license ONLY. If agent is also assigned admin roles, this could cause issue with accepting digital contacts.

4. Please follow the labs in the same order as they are provided. Some of the lambs would have dependencies.


## Lab Support

1. Proctors is your number 1 contact. If you need assistance just raise your hand.

2. All registered participants are also added to the support room where the engineering and Product Management team is added. As an alternative way, you can use that space for any questions related to the digital channels.
