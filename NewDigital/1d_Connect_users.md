## Lab Objective

This lab is designed to add new administrator users in Connect. This is an optional lab if you want to add more administrators to the connect tenant. The connect portal will be used only by Webex Contact Centre administrators.

## Pre-requisite

1. IMI Connect portal URL
2. Tenant Owner credentials to login to IMI Connect portal


# 1. Login to Connect portal

- Access IMI connect URL (this is specific to the tenant you are using) 
- Login with tenant owner credentials 
- The owner credential is usually sent to the WxCC tenant (partner Gold tenant) administrator once the IMI tenant provisioning is complete
    - Please contact your Cisco Partner Success Account Manager (PSAM) if there are any challenges identifying the IMI connect owner details
